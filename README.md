# SWIG demos

These are some demos of including C libraries into different higher-level languages using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org). They are taken more or less from the [SWIG Tutorial](http://www.swig.org/tutorial.html) and other SWIG documentation.

We currently have the following languages:

  * Java
  * Python
  * R
  * Ruby


## Usage

  1. Go to the directory of your programming language of choice
  2. Run `./build.sh`
  3. If there is a `run.sh` script, run that. Else, run `main.XXX` where `XXX` is the extension of your language (for R, you will have to do a `source("main.R")` from the interactive R prompt)
